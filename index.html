                My name is Dakota Lyons, also known as Kai, also known as Loralighte. My pronouns are They/them and She/her. I am a computer nut who is passionate, though without being the smartest. I learn by dropping myself into difficult projects, and running where I can.

                <span class="title">My beliefs</span><br>
                My belief is that no matter how low life is, you can make something good. With enough elbow-grease, anyone can do what they want. Everyone in their own way is an artist. Everyone deserves the right to create. Time + Effort = Skill. Sure, when you start, especially in situations you don't have any experience in, it will start bad. But just try, then redo, then redo, again and again, learning new ways to make things perform better for future projects.
            </p>
            <p class="mx-5">
                <span class="title">My code</span><br>
                It's admittedly not the best, but I at least put effort. I could say much I have done in each progreamming language, but admittedly to me that doesn't matter. What can be made in C can be made in Go, can be made Python, can be made in JavaScript. As long as it's a programming language, it works. I have most of my experience in C, C++, JavaScript, and Python, with experience in V and Go.
            </p>

                <span class="title">My projects</span><br>
                I work on <a href="https://potabi.com" target="_blank">The Potabi Foundation</a> in my time. My work dedicating itself to just fixing areas of software I dislike. I don't settle for anything, even if it means I read and struggle with learning how the hell a parser works just because no single programming language is perfect to me. I don't like the UNIX-philosophy, except for two things: Modularity, and make a beta as fast as possible. If you can mix five tasks into one product, make it do those five tasks.<br><br>
                Projects like operating systems, source control management tools that integrate other source control management tools, and other projects to simplify smaller aspects of my work.

                <span class="title">My education</span><br>
                I am simply, and completely, self-taught. I know more on how to read documentation than to program things I make. Documentation done wrong - <em>*ahem* PYTHON PLEASE FIX YOUR DOCUMENTATION!!!</em> - creates problems, so I like to make my own documentation make more sense. I like making things where a quick mention of use in the <code>README.md</code> is satisfying.
