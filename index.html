        Right now, I am going through a lot. I am planning to do a thorough
        announcement through
        <a href="https://foundation.potabi.com">The Potabi Foundation</a>
        soon-ish fully detailing what I am dealing with and why. However,
        I will give some details here, as I feel like my friends deserve to know
        where I have been, and people who care about me know the basics of what
        is happening.<br /><br />

        From December 24 (yep, Christmas Eve) to December 29 of 2021, I was in a
        mental hospital (total: 5 days).<br />
        From December 29, 2021 to Feburary 10, 2022 I was in my county's jail
        (total: 43 days).<br /><br />

        I will announce more once I am finished going through the courts and all
        that. My life is not over, even though I am losing a lot. It honestly
        hurts, but I will 100% fight to continue working on Potabi as soon as I
        possibly can! No promises that I will be able to return to work soon,
        however.
